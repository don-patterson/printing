This is a remix of the [Mario Star Chrismas Tree Topper](https://www.printables.com/model/651308-mario-star-christmas-tree-topper)
that has the additional wiring holes filled in. Grab the files from [Printables](https://www.printables.com/model/1102938-mario-star-christmas-tree-topper) or [Github](https://github.com/don-patterson/printing/tree/main/models/mario-tree-topper) and enjoy!

Everything printed fine in PLA at 0.2mm layers with 3 walls. I had to scale it all to 94% to fit on my Mk4 build plate.

The square hole variant is to make it print easier without supports. One minor drawback
is that not many plugs can fit through the small square hole (but if you slide the LED
strip in through the bottom after attaching the base, it works out well).

OpenSCAD file included as well, if you want to hack it further!

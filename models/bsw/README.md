## BSW
Boring Storage Wall: Inspired by/remix of
[Honeycomb Storage Wall](https://www.printables.com/model/152592-honeycomb-storage-wall)
by RostaP, of course, except I wanted a square grid instead of a honeycomb. I think I can also
easily align it with gridfinity bins this way (21mm wall units to align with the 42mm gridfinity
units).

## License Note
This code is my own, and released under the permissive Apache 2.0 license. However, as HSW is
released under Creative Commons 4.0 BY-NC, STLs and similar physical shapes produced from this
code are derivative works and must be released under the same license (or a stricter CC 4.0
version). The `stl` folder in this repo has that license file, so any files in and under that
directory are shared with the CC-BY-NC license.

This is still a work in progress, but the panels and insert base shape are pretty solid now. I've
started a small [roadmap](https://github.com/users/don-patterson/projects/5/views/1) but can't
really make any time commitments.

PrusaSlicer tip: If you have a 10x10 wall (210mm x 210mm) it's the max size of the Prusa MK4 print
bed, and won't align automatically by default. But if you manually specify 125 as the X (or Y, I
forget) position in the slicer, it will turn green and the slicer will accept it.

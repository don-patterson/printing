## BSW
Boring Storage Wall: Inspired by/remix of [Honeycomb Storage Wall](https://www.printables.com/model/152592-honeycomb-storage-wall)
by RostaP, of course, except I wanted a square grid instead of a honeycomb. I think I can also easily align it with gridfinity
bins this way (21mm wall units to align with the 42mm gridfinity units).

The STLs are available [here on Printables](https://www.printables.com/model/1211544-boring-storage-wall) if you'd like to preview
it there or make comments.  This is still a work in progress, but the panels and insert base shape are pretty solid now. I've
started a small [roadmap](https://github.com/users/don-patterson/projects/5/views/1) but can't really make any time commitments.

PrusaSlicer tip: If you have a 10x10 wall (210mm x 210mm) it's the max size of the Prusa MK4 print bed, and won't align
automatically by default. But if you manually specify a Y value of 105, it will turn green and the slicer will accept it.

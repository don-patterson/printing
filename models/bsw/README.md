Boring Storage Wall: Inspired by/remix of
[Honeycomb Storage Wall](https://www.printables.com/model/152592-honeycomb-storage-wall)
by RostaP, of course, except I wanted a square grid instead of a honeycomb. I think I can also
easily align it with gridfinity bins this way (21mm wall units to align with the 42mm gridfinity
units).

Still a work in progress, but the panels and insert base shape are pretty solid now. I've started
a small [roadmap](https://github.com/users/don-patterson/projects/5/views/1) but can't really
make any time commitments. 

PrusaSlicer tip: If you have a 10x10 wall (210mm x 210mm) it's the max size of the Prusa MK4 print
bed, and won't align automatically by default. But if you manually specify 125 as the X (or Y, I
forget) position in the slicer, it will turn green and the slicer will accept it.

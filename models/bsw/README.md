## BSW
Boring Storage Wall: inspired by HSW by RostaP, of course! I wanted a square grid
instead of a honeycomb, and I can also easily align it with gridfinity bins this
way (21mm wall units to align with the 42mm gridfinity units).

For a minute I was trying to make this general for any n, but of
course only a few shapes can easily be tiled.

Still a work in progress, but I think I have the board dimensions worked out
pretty well.

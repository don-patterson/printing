A handle for a bolted on lid, like for a rice cooker.
Adjust the hole size to be slightly smaller than the screw so
you can bore your own thread with the existing bolt.

I printed this with 4 vertical shells to give some strength
around the bolt. I confirmed PLA melts and the bolt threads
slip out at rice cooker temperatures. I'm trying PETG now,
which I hope will work. It gets _just_ too hot to keep your
hand on it, so pretty far from 100C I think. On Printables
